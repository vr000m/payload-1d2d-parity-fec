 RTP Payload Format for Non-Interleaved and Interleaved Parity Forward
                         Error Correction (FEC)
               draft-ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme-00

Abstract

   This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved
   and interleaved parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP.
   These parity codes are systematic codes, where a number of repair
   symbols are generated from a set of source symbols.  These repair
   symbols are sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that
   carries the source symbols.  The non-interleaved and interleaved
   parity codes offer a good protection against random and bursty packet
   losses, respectively, at a cost of decent complexity.  The RTP
   payload formats that are defined in this document address the
   scalability issues experienced with the earlier specifications
   including RFC 2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE 2022-1, and offer several
   improvements.  Due to these changes, the new payload formats are not
   backward compatible with the earlier specifications, but endpoints
   that do not implement the scheme can still work by simply ignoring
   the FEC packets.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) that is generated by the non-interleaved and
   interleaved parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP
   [RFC3550].  The type of the source media protected by these parity
   codes can be audio, video, text or application.  The FEC data are
   generated according to the media type parameters, which are
   communicated out-of-band (e.g., in SDP).  Furthermore, the
   associations or relationships between the source and repair flows may
   be communicated in-band or out-of-band.  Situtations where
   adaptivitiy of FEC parameters is desired, the endpoint can use the
   in-band mechanism, whereas when the FEC parameters are fixed, the
   endpoint may prefer to negotiate them out-of-band.

   Both the non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes use the
   eXclusive OR (XOR) operation to generate the repair symbols.  In a
   nutshell, the following steps take place:

   1.  The sender determines a set of source packets to be protected by
       FEC based on the media type parameters.

   2.  The sender applies the XOR operation on the source symbols to
       generate the required number of repair symbols.

   3.  The sender packetizes the repair symbols and sends the repair
       packet(s) along with the source packets to the receiver(s) (in
       different flows).  The repair packets may be sent proactively or
       on-demand.

   Note that the source and repair packets belong to different source
   and repair flows, and the sender must provide a way for the receivers
   to demultiplex them, even in the case they are sent in the same
   5-tuple (i.e., same source/destination address/port with UDP).  This
   is required to offer backward compatibility for endpoints that do not
   understand the FEC packets (See Section 4).  At the receiver side, if
   all of the source packets are successfully received, there is no need
   for FEC recovery and the repair packets are discarded.  However, if
   there are missing source packets, the repair packets can be used to
   recover the missing information.  Figure 1 and Figure 2 describe
   example block diagrams for the systematic parity FEC encoder and
   decoder, respectively.

   In Figure 2, it is clear that the FEC packets have to be received by
   the endpoint within a certain amount of time for the FEC recovery
   process to be useful.  In this document, we refer to the time that
   spans a FEC block, which consists of the source packets and the
   corresponding repair packets, as the repair window.  At the receiver
   side, the FEC decoder should wait at least for the duration of the
   repair window after getting the first packet in a FEC block, to allow
   all the repair packets to arrive.  (The waiting time can be adjusted
   if there are missing packets at the beginning of the FEC block.)  The
   FEC decoder can start decoding the already received packets sooner;

   however, it should not register a FEC decoding failure until it waits
   at least for the duration of the repair window.

   Suppose that we have a group of D x L source packets that have
   sequence numbers starting from 1 running to D x L, and a repair
   packet is generated by applying the XOR operation to every L
   consecutive packets as sketched in Figure 3.  This process is
   referred to as 1-D non-interleaved FEC protection.  As a result of
   this process, D repair packets are generated, which we refer to as
   non-interleaved (or row) FEC packets.

   If we apply the XOR operation to the group of the source packets
   whose sequence numbers are L apart from each other, as sketched in
   Figure 4.  In this case the endpoint generates L repair packets.
   This process is referred to as 1-D interleaved FEC protection, and
   the resulting L repair packets are referred to as interleaved (or
   column) FEC packets.

1.1.  Use Cases for 1-D FEC Protection

   We generate one non-interleaved repair packet out of L consecutive
   source packets or one interleaved repair packet out of D non-
   consecutive source packets.  Regardless of whether the repair packet
   is a non-interleaved or an interleaved one, it can provide a full
   recovery of the missing information if there is only one packet
   missing among the corresponding source packets.  This implies that
   1-D non-interleaved FEC protection performs better when the source
   packets are randomly lost.  However, if the packet losses occur in
   bursts, 1-D interleaved FEC protection performs better provided that
   L is chosen large enough, i.e., L-packet duration is not shorter than
   the observed burst duration.  If the sender generates non-interleaved
   FEC packets and a burst loss hits the source packets, the repair
   operation fails.  This is illustrated in Figure 5.

                     fails error recovery (Burst Loss)

   The sender may generate interleaved FEC packets to combat with the
   bursty packet losses.  However, two or more random packet losses may
   hit the source and repair packets in the same column.  In that case,
   the repair operation fails as well.  This is illustrated in Figure 6.
   Note that it is possible that two burst losses may occur back-to-
   back, in which case interleaved FEC packets may still fail to recover
   the lost data.

1.2.  Use Cases for 2-D Parity FEC Protection

   In networks where the source packets are lost both randomly and in
   bursts, the sender ought to generate both non-interleaved and
   interleaved FEC packets.  This type of FEC protection is known as 2-D
   parity FEC protection.  At the expense of generating more FEC

   packets, thus increasing the FEC overhead, 2-D FEC provides superior
   protection against mixed loss patterns.  However, it is still
   possible for 2-D parity FEC protection to fail to recover all of the
   lost source packets if a particular loss pattern occurs.  An example
   scenario is illustrated in Figure 7.

   2-D parity FEC protection also fails when at least two rows are
   missing a source and the FEC packet and the missing source packets
   (in at least two rows) are aligned in the same column.  An example
   loss pattern is sketched in Figure 8.  Similarly, 2-D parity FEC
   protection cannot repair all missing source packets when at least two
   columns are missing a source and the FEC packet and the missing
   source packets (in at least two columns) are aligned in the same row.

1.3.  Overhead Computation

   The overhead is defined as the ratio of the number of bytes belonging
   to the repair packets to the number of bytes belonging to the
   protected source packets.

   Generally, repair packets are larger in size compared to the source
   packets.  Also, not all the source packets are necessarily equal in
   size.  However, if we assume that each repair packet carries an equal
   number of bytes carried by a source packet, we can compute the
   overhead for different FEC protection methods as follows:

   o  1-D Non-interleaved FEC Protection: Overhead = 1/L

   o  1-D Interleaved FEC Protection: Overhead = 1/D

   o  2-D Parity FEC Protection: Overhead = 1/L + 1/D

   where L and D are the number of columns and rows in the source block,
   respectively.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Definitions and Notations

3.1.  Definitions

   This document uses a number of definitions from [RFC6363].

3.2.  Notations

   o  L: Number of columns of the source block.

   o  D: Number of rows of the source block.

   o  bitmask: Run-length encoding of packets protected by a FEC packet.
      If the bit i in the mask is set to 1, the source packet number N +
      i is protected by this FEC packet.  Here, N is the sequence number
      base, which is indicated in the FEC packet as well.

4.  Packet Formats

   This section defines the formats of the source and repair packets.

4.1.  Source Packets

   The source packets MUST contain the information that identifies the
   source block and the position within the source block occupied by the
   packet.  Since the source packets that are carried within an RTP
   stream already contain unique sequence numbers in their RTP headers
   [RFC3550], we can identify the source packets in a straightforward
   manner and there is no need to append additional field(s).  The
   primary advantage of not modifying the source packets in any way is
   that it provides backward compatibility for the receivers that do not
   support FEC at all.  In multicast scenarios, this backward
   compatibility becomes quite useful as it allows the non-FEC-capable
   and FEC-capable receivers to receive and interpret the same source
   packets sent in the same multicast session.

4.2.  Repair Packets

   The repair packets MUST contain information that identifies the
   source block they pertain to and the relationship between the
   contained repair symbols and the original source block.  For this
   purpose, we use the RTP header of the repair packets as well as
   another header within the RTP payload, which we refer to as the FEC
   header, as shown in Figure 9.

                    Figure 9: Format of repair packets

   The RTP header is formatted according to [RFC3550] with some further
   clarifications listed below:

   o  Marker (M) Bit: This bit is not used for this payload type, and
      SHALL be set to 0.

   o  Payload Type: The (dynamic) payload type for the repair packets is
      determined through out-of-band means.  Note that this document
      registers new payload formats for the repair packets (Refer to
      Section 5 for details).  According to [RFC3550], an RTP receiver
      that cannot recognize a payload type must discard it.  This
      provides backward compatibility.  If a non-FEC-capable receiver
      receives a repair packet, it will not recognize the payload type,
      and hence, will discard the repair packet.

   o  Sequence Number (SN): The sequence number has the standard
      definition.  It MUST be one higher than the sequence number in the
      previously transmitted repair packet.  The initial value of the
      sequence number SHOULD be random (unpredictable, based on
      [RFC3550]).

   o  Timestamp (TS): The timestamp SHALL be set to a time corresponding
      to the repair packet's transmission time.  Note that the timestamp
      value has no use in the actual FEC protection process and is
      usually useful for jitter calculations.

   o  Synchronization Source (SSRC): The SSRC value SHALL be randomly
      assigned as suggested by [RFC3550].  This allows the sender to
      multiplex the source and repair flows on the same port, or
      multiplex multiple repair flows on a single port.  The repair
      flows SHOULD use the RTCP CNAME field to associate themselves with
      the source flow.

      In some networks, the RTP Source, which produces the source
      packets and the FEC Source, which generates the repair packets
      from the source packets may not be the same host.  In such
      scenarios, using the same CNAME for the source and repair flows
      means that the RTP Source and the FEC Source MUST share the same
      CNAME (for this specific source-repair flow association).  A
      common CNAME may be produced based on an algorithm that is known
      both to the RTP and FEC Source [RFC7022].  This usage is compliant
      with [RFC3550].

      Note that due to the randomness of the SSRC assignments, there is
      a possibility of SSRC collision.  In such cases, the collisions
      MUST be resolved as described in [RFC3550].

   The format of the FEC header is shown in Figure 10.

   o  The P, X, CC, M and PT recovery fields are used to determine the
      corresponding fields of the recovered packets.

   o  The SN base field is used to indicate the lowest sequence number,
      taking wrap around into account, of those source packets protected
      by this repair packet.

   o  The TS recovery field is used to determine the timestamp of the
      recovered packets.

   o  The Length recovery field is used to determine the length of the
      recovered packets.

   o  Mask is a run-length encoding of packets protected by the FEC
      packet.  Where a bit i set to 1 indicates that the source packet
      with sequence number (SN base + i) is protected by this FEC
      packet.

   o  If the the MSK field is set to 11, it indicates the offset of
      packets protected by this FEC packet.  Consequently, the following
      conditions may occur:

   If M=0, N=0,  regular protection pattern code with the values of
                 L and D are indicared in the SDP description.
   If M>0, N=0,  indicates a non-interleaved (row) FEC of M packets
                 starting at SN base.
                 Hence, FEC = SN, SN+1, SN+2, ... , SN+(M-1), SN+M.
   If M>0, N>0,  indicates interleaved (column) FEC of every M packet
                 in a group of N packets starting at SN base.
                 Hence, FEC = SN+(Mx0), SN+(Mx1), ... , SN+(MxN).

             Figure 12: Interpreting the M and N field values

   The details on setting the fields in the FEC header are provided in
   Section 6.2.

   It should be noted that a mask-based approach (similar to the ones
   specified in [RFC2733] and [RFC5109]) may not be very efficient to
   indicate which source packets in the current source block are
   associated with a given repair packet.  In particular, for the
   applications that would like to use large source block sizes, the
   size of the mask that is required to describe the source-repair
   packet associations may be prohibitively large.  The 8-bit fields
   proposed in [SMPTE2022-1] indicate a systematized approach.  Instead
   the approach in this document uses the 8-bit fields to indicate
   packet offsets protected by the FEC packet.  The approach in
   [SMPTE2022-1] is inherently more efficient for regular patterns, it

   does not provide flexibility to represent other protection patterns

5.2.  Mapping to SDP Parameters

   Applications that are using RTP transport commonly use Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] to describe their RTP sessions.
   The information that is used to specify the media types in an RTP
   session has specific mappings to the fields in an SDP description.
   In this section, we provide these mappings for the media subtypes
   registered by this document.  Note that if an application does not
   use SDP to describe the RTP sessions, an appropriate mapping must be
   defined and used to specify the media types and their parameters for
   the control/description protocol employed by the application.

   The mapping of the media type specification for "non-interleaved-
   parityfec" and "interleaved-parityfec" and their parameters in SDP is
   as follows:

   o  The media type (e.g., "application") goes into the "m=" line as
      the media name.

   o  The media subtype goes into the "a=rtpmap" line as the encoding
      name.  The RTP clock rate parameter ("rate") also goes into the
      "a=rtpmap" line as the clock rate.

   o  The remaining required payload-format-specific parameters go into
      the "a=fmtp" line by copying them directly from the media type
      string as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   SDP examples are provided in Section 7.

5.2.1.  Offer-Answer Model Considerations

   When offering 1-D interleaved parity FEC over RTP using SDP in an
   Offer/Answer model [RFC3264], the following considerations apply:

   o  Each combination of the L and D parameters produces a different
      FEC data and is not compatible with any other combination.  A
      sender application may desire to offer multiple offers with
      different sets of L and D values as long as the parameter values
      are valid.  The receiver SHOULD normally choose the offer that has
      a sufficient amount of interleaving.  If multiple such offers
      exist, the receiver may choose the offer that has the lowest
      overhead or the one that requires the smallest amount of
      buffering.  The selection depends on the application requirements.

   o  The value for the repair-window parameter depends on the L and D
      values and cannot be chosen arbitrarily.  More specifically, L and
      D values determine the lower limit for the repair-window size.




Singh, et al.            Expires August 18, 2015               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft      RTP Payload Format for Parity FEC      February 2015


      The upper limit of the repair-window size does not depend on the L
      and D values.

   o  Although combinations with the same L and D values but with
      different repair-window sizes produce the same FEC data, such
      combinations are still considered different offers.  The size of
      the repair-window is related to the maximum delay between the
      transmission of a source packet and the associated repair packet.
      This directly impacts the buffering requirement on the receiver
      side and the receiver must consider this when choosing an offer.

   o  There are no optional format parameters defined for this payload.
      Any unknown option in the offer MUST be ignored and deleted from
      the answer.  If FEC is not desired by the receiver, it can be
      deleted from the answer.

5.2.2.  Declarative Considerations

   In declarative usage, like SDP in the Real-time Streaming Protocol
   (RTSP) [RFC2326] or the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974], the following considerations apply:

   o  The payload format configuration parameters are all declarative
      and a participant MUST use the configuration that is provided for
      the session.

   o  More than one configuration may be provided (if desired) by
      declaring multiple RTP payload types.  In that case, the receivers
      should choose the repair flow that is best for them.

6.  Protection and Recovery Procedures

   This section provides a complete specification of the 1-D and 2-D
   parity codes and their RTP payload formats.

6.1.  Overview

   The following sections specify the steps involved in generating the
   repair packets and reconstructing the missing source packets from the
   repair packets.

6.2.  Repair Packet Construction

   The RTP header of a repair packet is formed based on the guidelines
   given in Section 4.2.

   The FEC header includes 12 octets (or upto 28 octets when the longer
   optional masks are used).  It is constructed by applying the XOR



Singh, et al.            Expires August 18, 2015               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft      RTP Payload Format for Parity FEC      February 2015


   operation on the bit strings that are generated from the individual
   source packets protected by this particular repair packet.  The set
   of the source packets that are associated with a given repair packet
   can be computed by the formula given in Section 6.3.1.

   The bit string is formed for each source packet by concatenating the
   following fields together in the order specified:

   o  The first 64 bits of the RTP header (64 bits).

   o  Unsigned network-ordered 16-bit representation of the source
      packet length in bytes minus 12 (for the fixed RTP header), i.e.,
      the sum of the lengths of all the following if present: the CSRC
      list, extension header, RTP payload and RTP padding (16 bits).

   By applying the parity operation on the bit strings produced from the
   source packets, we generate the FEC bit string.  The FEC header is
   generated from the FEC bit string as follows:

   o  The first (most significant) 2 bits in the FEC bit string are
      skipped.  The MSK bits in the FEC header are set to the
      appropriate value, i.e., it depends on the chosen bitmask length.

   o  The next bit in the FEC bit string is written into the P recovery
      bit in the FEC header.

   o  The next bit in the FEC bit string is written into the X recovery
      bit in the FEC header.

   o  The next 4 bits of the FEC bit string are written into the CC
      recovery field in the FEC header.

   o  The next bit is written into the M recovery bit in the FEC header.

   o  The next 7 bits of the FEC bit string are written into the PT
      recovery field in the FEC header.

   o  The next 16 bits are skipped.

   o  The next 32 bits of the FEC bit string are written into the TS
      recovery field in the FEC header.

   o  The next 16 bits are written into the length recovery field in the
      FEC header.

   o  Depending on the chosen MSK value, the bit mask of appropriate
      length will be set to the appropriate values.




Singh, et al.            Expires August 18, 2015               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft      RTP Payload Format for Parity FEC      February 2015


   As described in Section 4.2, the SN base field of the FEC header MUST
   be set to the lowest sequence number of the source packets protected
   by this repair packet.  When MSK represents a bitmask (MSK=00,01,10),
   the SN base field corresponds to the lowest sequence number indicated
   in the bitmask.  When MSK=11, the following considerations apply: 1)
   for the interleaved FEC packets, this corresponds to the lowest
   sequence number of the source packets that forms the column, 2) for
   the non-interleaved FEC packets, the SN base field MUST be set to the
   lowest sequence number of the source packets that forms the row.

   The repair packet payload consists of the bits that are generated by
   applying the XOR operation on the payloads of the source RTP packets.
   If the payload lengths of the source packets are not equal, each
   shorter packet MUST be padded to the length of the longest packet by
   adding octet 0's at the end.

   Due to this possible padding and mandatory FEC header, a repair
   packet has a larger size than the source packets it protects.  This
   may cause problems if the resulting repair packet size exceeds the
   Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size of the path over which the
   repair flow is sent.

6.3.  Source Packet Reconstruction

   This section describes the recovery procedures that are required to
   reconstruct the missing source packets.  The recovery process has two
   steps.  In the first step, the FEC decoder determines which source
   and repair packets should be used in order to recover a missing
   packet.  In the second step, the decoder recovers the missing packet,
   which consists of an RTP header and RTP payload.

   In the following, we describe the RECOMMENDED algorithms for the
   first and second steps.  Based on the implementation, different
   algorithms MAY be adopted.  However, the end result MUST be identical
   to the one produced by the algorithms described below.

   Note that the same algorithms are used by the 1-D parity codes,
   regardless of whether the FEC protection is applied over a column or
   a row.  The 2-D parity codes, on the other hand, usually require
   multiple iterations of the procedures described here.  This iterative
   decoding algorithm is further explained in Section 6.3.4.

6.3.1.  Associating the Source and Repair Packets

   We denote the set of the source packets associated with repair packet
   p* by set T(p*).  Note that in a source block whose size is L columns
   by D rows, set T includes D source packets plus one repair packet for
   the FEC protection applied over a column, and L source packets plus



Singh, et al.            Expires August 18, 2015               [Page 28]

Internet-Draft      RTP Payload Format for Parity FEC      February 2015


   one repair packet for the FEC protection applied over a row.  Recall
   that 1-D interleaved and non-interleaved FEC protection can fully
   recover the missing information if there is only one source packet
   missing in set T.  If there are more than one source packets missing
   in set T, 1-D FEC protection will not work.

6.3.1.1.  Signaled in SDP

   The first step is associating the source and repair packets.  If the
   endpoint relies entirely on out-of-band signaling (MSK=11, and
   M=N=0), then this information may be inferred from the media type
   parameters specified in the SDP description.  Furtheremore, the
   payload type field in the RTP header, assists the receiver
   distinguish an interleaved or non-interleaved FEC packet.

   Mathematically, for any received repair packet, p*, we can determine
   the sequence numbers of the source packets that are protected by this
   repair packet as follows:

                             p*_snb + i * X_1 (modulo 65536)

   where p*_snb denotes the value in the SN base field of p*'s FEC
   header, X_1 is set to L and 1 for the interleaved and non-interleaved
   FEC packets, respectively, and

                                      0 <= i < X_2

   where X_2 is set to D and L for the interleaved and non-interleaved
   FEC packets, respectively.

6.3.1.2.  Using bitmasks

   When using fixed size bitmasks (16-, 48-, 112-bits), the SN base
   field in the FEC header indicates the lowest sequence number of the
   source packets that forms the FEC packet.  Finally, the bits maked by
   "1" in the bitmask are offsets from the SN base and make up the rest
   of the packets protected by the FEC packet.  The bitmasks are able to
   represent arbitrary protection patterns, for example, 1-D
   interleaved, 1-D non-interleaved, 2-D, staircase.

6.3.1.3.  Using M and N Offsets

   When value of M is non-zero, the 8-bit fields indicate the offset of
   packets protected by an interleaved (N>0) or non-interleaved (N=0)
   FEC packet.  Using a combination of interleaved and non-interleaved
   FEC packets can form 2-D protection patterns.

Internet-Draft      RTP Payload Format for Parity FEC      February 2015


   Mathematically, for any received repair packet, p*, we can determine
   the sequence numbers of the source packets that are protected by this
   repair packet are as follows:

              When N = 0:
  p*_snb, p*_snb+1,..., p*_snb+(M-1), p*_snb+M
When N > 0:
  p*_snb, p*_snb+(Mx1), p*_snb+(Mx2),..., p*_snb+(Mx(N-1)), p*_snb+(MxN)

6.3.2.  Recovering the RTP Header

   For a given set T, the procedure for the recovery of the RTP header
   of the missing packet, whose sequence number is denoted by SEQNUM, is
   as follows:

   1.   For each of the source packets that are successfully received in
        T, compute the 80-bit string by concatenating the first 64 bits
        of their RTP header and the unsigned network-ordered 16-bit
        representation of their length in bytes minus 12.

   2.   For the repair packet in T, compute the FEC bit string from the
        first 80 bits of the FEC header.

   3.   Calculate the recovered bit string as the XOR of the bit strings
        generated from all source packets in T and the FEC bit string
        generated from the repair packet in T.

   4.   Create a new packet with the standard 12-byte RTP header and no
        payload.

   5.   Set the version of the new packet to 2.  Skip the first 2 bits
        in the recovered bit string.

   6.   Set the Padding bit in the new packet to the next bit in the
        recovered bit string.

   7.   Set the Extension bit in the new packet to the next bit in the
        recovered bit string.

   8.   Set the CC field to the next 4 bits in the recovered bit string.

   9.   Set the Marker bit in the new packet to the next bit in the
        recovered bit string.

   10.  Set the Payload type in the new packet to the next 7 bits in the
        recovered bit string.

Internet-Draft      RTP Payload Format for Parity FEC      February 2015


   11.  Set the SN field in the new packet to SEQNUM.  Skip the next 16
        bits in the recovered bit string.

   12.  Set the TS field in the new packet to the next 32 bits in the
        recovered bit string.

   13.  Take the next 16 bits of the recovered bit string and set the
        new variable Y to whatever unsigned integer this represents
        (assuming network order).  Convert Y to host order.  Y
        represents the length of the new packet in bytes minus 12 (for
        the fixed RTP header), i.e., the sum of the lengths of all the
        following if present: the CSRC list, header extension, RTP
        payload and RTP padding.

   14.  Set the SSRC of the new packet to the SSRC of the source RTP
        stream.

   This procedure recovers the header of an RTP packet up to (and
   including) the SSRC field.

6.3.3.  Recovering the RTP Payload

   Following the recovery of the RTP header, the procedure for the
   recovery of the RTP payload is as follows:

   1.  Append Y bytes to the new packet.

   2.  For each of the source packets that are successfully received in
       T, compute the bit string from the Y octets of data starting with
       the 13th octet of the packet.  If any of the bit strings
       generated from the source packets has a length shorter than Y,
       pad them to that length.  The padding of octet 0 MUST be added at
       the end of the bit string.  Note that the information of the
       first 8 octets are protected by the FEC header.

   3.  For the repair packet in T, compute the FEC bit string from the
       repair packet payload, i.e., the Y octets of data following the
       FEC header.  Note that the FEC header may be 12, 16, 32 octets
       depending on the length of the bitmask.

   4.  Calculate the recovered bit string as the XOR of the bit strings

6.3.4.  Iterative Decoding Algorithm for the 2-D Parity FEC Protection

   In 2-D parity FEC protection, the sender generates both non-
   interleaved and interleaved FEC packets to combat with the mixed loss
   patterns (random and bursty).  At the receiver side, these FEC
   packets are used iteratively to overcome the shortcomings of the 1-D
   non-interleaved/interleaved FEC protection and improve the chances of
   full error recovery.

   The iterative decoding algorithm runs as follows:

   1.  Set num_recovered_until_this_iteration to zero

   2.  Set num_recovered_so_far to zero

   3.  Recover as many source packets as possible by using the non-
       interleaved FEC packets as outlined in Section 6.3.2 and
       Section 6.3.3, and increase the value of num_recovered_so_far by
       the number of recovered source packets.

   4.  Recover as many source packets as possible by using the
       interleaved FEC packets as outlined in Section 6.3.2 and
       Section 6.3.3, and increase the value of num_recovered_so_far by
       the number of recovered source packets.

   5.  If num_recovered_so_far > num_recovered_until_this_iteration
       ---num_recovered_until_this_iteration = num_recovered_so_far
       ---Go to step 3
       Else
       ---Terminate

   The algorithm terminates either when all missing source packets are
   fully recovered or when there are still remaining missing source
   packets but the FEC packets are not able to recover any more source
   packets.  For the example scenarios when the 2-D parity FEC
   protection fails full recovery, refer to Section 1.2.  Upon
   termination, variable num_recovered_so_far has a value equal to the
   total number of recovered source packets.

   Example:

   Suppose that the receiver experienced the loss pattern sketched in
   Figure 13.

7.  SDP Examples

   This section provides two SDP [RFC4566] examples.  The examples use
   the FEC grouping semantics defined in [RFC4756].

7.1.  Example SDP for 1-D Parity FEC Protection

   In this example, we have one source video stream (ssrc:1234) and one
   FEC repair stream (ssrc:2345).  We form one FEC group with the
   "a=ssrc-group:FEC-FR 1234 2345" line.  The source and repair streams
   are multiplexed on different SSRCs.  The repair window is set to 200
   ms.

7.2.  Example SDP for 2-D Parity FEC Protection

   In this example, we have one source video stream (ssrc:1234) and two
   FEC repair streams (ssrc:2345 and ssrc:3456).  We form one FEC group
   with the "a=ssrc-group:FEC-FR 1234 2345 3456" line.  The source and
   repair streams are multiplexed on different SSRCs.  The repair window
   is set to 200 ms.

        o=ali 1122334455 1122334466 IN IP4 fec.example.com

        a=rtpmap:110 interleaved-parityfec/90000
        a=fmtp:110 L:5; D:10; ToP:2; repair-window:200000
        a=rtpmap:111 non-interleaved-parityfec/90000
        a=fmtp:111 L:5; D:10; ToP:2; repair-window:200000
        a=ssrc:1234
        a=ssrc:2345
        a=ssrc:3456
        a=ssrc-group:FEC-FR 1234 2345 3456

   Note that the sender might be generating two repair flows carrying
   non-interleaved and interleaved FEC packets, however the receiver
   might be interested only in the interleaved FEC packets.  The
   receiver can identify the repair flow carrying the desired repair
   data by checking the payload types associated with each repair flow
   described in the SDP description.

8.  Congestion Control Considerations

   FEC is an effective approach to provide applications resiliency
   against packet losses.  However, in networks where the congestion is
   a major contributor to the packet loss, the potential impacts of
   using FEC SHOULD be considered carefully before injecting the repair
   flows into the network.  In particular, in bandwidth-limited
   networks, FEC repair flows may consume most or all of the available
   bandwidth and consequently may congest the network.  In such cases,
   the applications MUST NOT arbitrarily increase the amount of FEC
   protection since doing so may lead to a congestion collapse.  If
   desired, stronger FEC protection MAY be applied only after the source
   rate has been reduced [I-D.singh-rmcat-adaptive-fec].

   In a network-friendly implementation, an application SHOULD NOT send/
   receive FEC repair flows if it knows that sending/receiving those FEC
   repair flows would not help at all in recovering the missing packets.

Internet-Draft      RTP Payload Format for Parity FEC      February 2015


   However, it MAY still continue to use FEC if considered for bandwidth
   estimation instead of speculatively probe for additional capacity
   [Holmer13][Nagy14].  It is RECOMMENDED that the amount of FEC
   protection is adjusted dynamically based on the packet loss rate
   observed by the applications.

   In multicast scenarios, it may be difficult to optimize the FEC
   protection per receiver.  If there is a large variation among the
   levels of FEC protection needed by different receivers, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the sender offers multiple repair flows with
   different levels of FEC protection and the receivers join the
   corresponding multicast sessions to receive the repair flow(s) that
   is best for them.

   Editor's note: Additional congestion control considerations regarding
   the use of 2-D parity codes should be added here.

9.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550] and in any applicable RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting the
   RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a
   suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Such a
   cryptographic system may also allow the authentication of the source
   of the payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload
   format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and at
   least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet
   is from a member of the RTP session.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the
   application, transport and signaling protocol employed.  Therefore, a
   single mechanism is not sufficient, although if suitable, using the
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is recommended.
   Other mechanisms that may be used are IPsec [RFC4301] and Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (RTP over TCP); other alternatives may
   exist.

10.  IANA Considerations

   New media subtypes are subject to IANA registration.  For the
   registration of the payload formats and their parameters introduced
   in this document, refer to Section 5.
